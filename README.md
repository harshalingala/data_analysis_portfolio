# Data analysis portfolio
This is repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in data analytics / data science related topics
## Projects
This Section contains the links to code and notebooks I created for various projects and learning libraries.
### IBM data science capstone project
**Description:** This is part of IBM data science certificate. [Course official page](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone/home/info)
<br>In this project we use Machine learning models to derive insights from publicly available spaceX data. We use the features to predict the landing outcome of first stage rocket.  We use Python APIs for data collection, web scraping, data exploration, data visualization, model development and model evaluation.

### F1 Data Analysis
**Description:**<br>
This repository contains code and notebooks related to formula1 data analysis. We use "fastf1" python API to access the formula1 telemetry data and plot using "matplotlib" library.
<br>

### Pyspark tutorial
**Description**<br>
This repository containg the notes related to pyspark library. We use pyspark functions for data pre processing and fit the data to machine learning models like clutering, regression, etc.
